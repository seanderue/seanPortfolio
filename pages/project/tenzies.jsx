            <h1 className={styles.title}>Multiplayer Tenzies</h1>
            <p className={styles.body_text}>This was my first-ever significant project. Originally I wanted to make a table-top multiplayer game, but it didnâ€™t take long to realize I had bit off more than I could chew. Instead, I made the back-end additions necessary to this game that I created at the end of a scrimba-react course. I had really pushed myself on this project, so I remember it fondly.</p>
              <h4 className={styles.subtitle}>Goal</h4>
              <p className={styles.body_text}>Learn about websockets and database building to create a real-time dice game that could be played by my friends in-between League of Legends queue timers.</p>
              <h4 className={styles.subtitle}>Project Features</h4>
              <ul className={styles.body_bullet_list}>
                <li>Server-validated game logic</li>
                <li>Real-time player interaction through websocket connections</li>
                <li>JSON Database updated live on the server</li>
                <li>Fun confetti upon winning ðŸ˜‰</li>
              </ul>
              <h4 className={styles.subtitle}>Outcome</h4>
              <p className={styles.body_text}>I made a playable game! The back-end is server-validated. So Player A make an input, the server takes the data, runs it through the game logic, and updates the client-side state of Players A, B, C, and D in the target game-room.
                <br/><br/>
                I definitely learned how unglamorous backend can be, as I put in a lot of work for someone to click a dice and have it turn green on multiple clients. That said, I have the barebones framework complete, and it would be relatively easy to add more features like player power-ups/weapons that they could interact with the enemy board with.
                <br/><br/>
                Eventually Iâ€™d like to go back and polish the CSS and add those features. But for a project that was meant to learn how to build my own back-end &amp; real-time database, (while working on my React muscles), I checked my boxes. <br/><br/>At the time, I had to get rolling on more projects so I could be that much closer to employment.</p>
